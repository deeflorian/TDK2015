\chapter{System Level Runtime Verification}
	\label{chap:cep}
		In this chapter we summarize the basic concepts of System Level Runtime Verification,
		overview of the Complex Event Processing approach and we suggest an intermediate language as a formal framework of our approach
	
	\section{Complex Event Processing using technologies}
	
	
	
		In the proposed hierarchical runtime verification approach, the top level of modelling and analysis is supported by a Complex Event Processing Framework.
		
		In our project we are going to do so, and define Event Patterns at the system level.
		Our choice for CEP is the VIATRA CEP, because it's the only open source CEP with 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a live model integration, 
			\item where you can define graph patterns to the model, and automatically generate atomic events on the appearance and disappearance of these patterns.
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		VIATRA CEP uses a language called VIATRA Event Pattern Language (VEPL for short).
		This language is perfect for our approach, it has intuitive syntax, and the event patterns can be defined in
		a very high level way, ??? not well-formalized, and the
		execution of the patterns are dependent on so called ``event contexts'' which makes formalization extremely difficult.
		
		We propose an intermediate language, to formalize the system level Runtime Verification task.
		The proposed formalism supports the formalization of the used CEP language.
		In addition, it also makes the framework more extensible as other engineering models can be integrated above the intermediate language.

		The operators of the language are shown in \cref{tab:cep:veplop}. 
		The syntactic sugars are shown in \cref{tab:cep:veplsugar},
		but we are going to ignore these, since they can be translated to the basic operators as shown in \cref{tab:cep:veplsugartobasic}.
		
		We are going to introduce every step through an example, which is about the runtime verification of a two phase lock algorithm. %% TODO Reference
		In the two phase locking algorithm there are two rules :
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Resources must be allocated in a previously defined sequence, which is the same for all tasks
			\item If a task releases a resource, it's not allowed to allocate anything anymore.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		Since this example uses resources, we have to define the following behaviour:
		each resource can be allocated once before every release, and can be released once before every allocation.
		
		To show the usefulness of the expressiveness of our language in usage critical system, where timeouts are common, we will extend the requirements:
		The first phase must finish after 10 seconds,
		i.e. the time between the first allocation and the first release must be less than 10 seconds\footnote{In the final 
		example we are going to change this, to ``A resource can not be in allocated state for more than 10 sec'', but to 
		only have one automaton, we will use this rule right now.}.

		\subsection{Regular Expression}
		
			In this particular example, we need a language to describe event sequences. To do so, one of the most common
			formalism is a Regular Expression, where the alphabet is the set of possible events.
		
			\begin{dfn}
				(Left Derivate).\footnote{reference timed.pdf}
				For every two sequences $u$ and $v$ the left derivate of $u$ by $v$
				is a partial function defined as:
				%
				\[ v \setminus u
					\begin{cases}
						w & \text{ if } \exists w,u = vw \\
						\perp & \text{otherwise}
					\end{cases}
				\]
				%
				In other words, $v \setminus u$ is defined if $v$ is a prefix of $u$,
				and in that case $v$ is removed.
			\end{dfn}
			
			\begin{dfn}
				(Absorbing concatenation).
				The partial operator $u \circ v$ on $\mathcal{T}$ is defined as:
				\[ u \circ v = u \cdot (\lambda (u) \setminus v) \]
			\end{dfn}
			
			\begin{dfn}
				\label{dfn:cep:re}
				Regular Expressions over an alphabet $\Sigma$ (also referred to as $\Sigma$-expressions)
				are defined using the following families of rules.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \underline{$a$} for every letter $a \in \Sigma$ and the special symbol $\varepsilon$ are expressions.
					\item If $\varphi, \varphi_1, \varphi_2$ are $\Sigma$-expressions then %
						$ %
						\varphi_1~\cdot~\varphi_2,
						\varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2,
						\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2,
						\varphi_1 \wedge \varphi_2,
						\varphi^\ast,
						\varphi^\circledast
						$ are $\Sigma$-expressions.
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{dfn}
			
			To illustrate the usage of the Regular Expressions in the two phase locking example we are going to describe the behaviour of one resource with a simple VEPL pattern:
			$(a \rightarrow f)\{\ast\}$\note{$a$ stands for  } which means that an infinite sequences of allocation and release are allowed after each other. This is equivalent to the 
			regular expression : $(af)\ast$.

			\subsubsection{Deterministic Finite Automaton}
				To match regular expressions, the most common solution is to construct an automaton accepting the language generated by the regular expressions. Variuous algorithms
				exist for the generation of Deterministic Finite Automaton from Regular Expressions
				
				
				\begin{dfn}
					\label{dfn:cep:ea}
					An Event Automaton (Deterministic Finite Event Automaton in other words) is a tuple $\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta_d,q_0, F \rangle$  where: 
						\begin{itemize}
							\item $Q$ is a finite, nonempty set. These are the states of the automaton,
							\item $\Sigma$ is a finite, nonempty set. This is the Event set of the automaton,
							\item $\delta_d$ is a subset of tuples $\langle Q \times \Sigma \times Q \rangle$,
								and the number of outgoing edges from each state for each event is only one 
								i.e. $\forall q_0 \in Q$ and $\forall e_0 \in \Sigma$ : $|\langle q_0, e_0, q_1 \rangle| = 1$, where $q_1 \in Q$ 
							\item $q_0 \in Q$ the initial state,
							\item $F \subseteq Q$ the set of the accepting states.
						\end{itemize}	
				\end{dfn}
				
				Just to illustrate the operation of the Finite Automata we can use a token assigned to the active state.

				The semantic is the following : 
				At initialization the token is at state $f_0$.
				If the token enters state $s'$ where $s' \in F$ then we accept the event trace. 
				When receiving input $e$, where $e \in \Sigma$, if the token\footnote{define} is on state $s$ the next state will be $s'$ where % Define token from semantics
				$\delta_d \langle s,e,s' \rangle$. For short, from now we will use the notation $s \rightarrow s'$. 
				
				The regular expression of the example can be compiled to this automaton.
				
				$a\ast r \ast a$
				
				TODO add picture.
				

			
		\subsection{Timed Regular Expression}
		
			Using the previously defined semantics we can not express timed properties,
			but regular expressions can be expanded to a formalism which can do so : 
			the Timed Regular Expressions
			

			\begin{dfn}
				\label{dfn:cep:tre}
				Timed Regular Expressions over an alphabet $\Sigma$ (also referred to as $\Sigma$-expressions)
				are defined using the following rules~\citep{tre}~.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \underline{$a$} for every letter $a \in \Sigma$ and the special symbol $\varepsilon$ are expressions.
					\item If $\varphi, \varphi_1, \varphi_2$ are $\Sigma$-expressions then %
						$ %
						\varphi_1~\cdot~\varphi_2,
						\varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2,
						\varphi_1 \circ \varphi_2,
						\varphi_1 \wedge \varphi_2,
						\varphi^\ast,
						\varphi^\circledast,
						\langle \varphi \rangle_I$, 
						where $I$ is an Interval, are $\Sigma$-expressions.
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{dfn}
			
			\subsubsection{Timed Event Automaton}
				For accepting languages generated by timed regular expressions, we introduce the timed event automaton.
				
				\begin{dfn}
					\label{dfn:cep:tea}
					A Timed Event Automaton $\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0, F, t, T \rangle$ where
					\begin{itemize}
						\item $Q, \Sigma, q_0,$ and $F$ are the same as in Definition \ref{dfn:cep:ea},
						\item $t$ is a global clock variable $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
						\item $T$ is a set of local timeout clocks, i.e. a subset of tuples $\langle Q, \RR \rangle$ assigning timeouts to states.
						\item and $\delta$ is the union of discrete and timed transitions i.e. $\delta_t \cup \delta_d$ where
						\begin{itemize}
							\item $\delta_d$ is defined as in Definition \ref{dfn:cep:ea},
							\item and $\delta_t$ represents timed transitions and defined as the set of tuples $\langle Q \times \mathbb{R} \times Q \rangle$ 
						\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
				\end{dfn}
				
				The semantic of the Timed Deterministic Finite Automaton is defined as follows:
				
				
				
				$Q_t \subseteq Q$ is the set of states with outgoing timed transitions, 
				i.e. $\forall s \in Q_t$ : $ \exists \delta_t\langle s, t, s' \rangle$, where $t \in \RR$ and $s' \in Q$.
				We have to define rules for entering states with timed outgoing transitions and we also define the general rules of changing states. 
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Initialization Rule : On initialization of the automaton, we have to set all clocks to $\infty$ 
					i.e. $\forall t_i \forall q_i T \langle q_i, t_i \rangle, t_i \coloneqq \infty $
					
					\item Entering Timed State Rule: On entry to state $s$ where $s \in Q_t$ the timeout variable $t_s$ of the state is set according to the value of the global time and the timeout value of the output transition $t_{timeout}$:
						$t_s\coloneqq t+t_{timeout}$
						where $T\langle s,t_s \rangle$ and $\delta_t\langle s,t_{timeouts},s' \rangle$ where $t_{timeout}$ is minimal from the set of possible $t_{timeouts}$ 
					
					\item Firing Transitions Rule: Non-deterministically choose an enabled transition from the set of enabled discrete or timed transitions. 
						$s$ is the currently active state, and $s'$ is the next state according to $\delta$.
						We have two cases, the chosen transition is:
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Discrete Transition: In case of $s' \notin Q_t$ than the execution of the transition is as described formerly. 
							If we exit state $s \in Q_t$ by a transition in $\delta_d$, 
							then the following rule extends the firing rule of discrete transitions by invalidating the corresponding timeout values:
								$t_s \coloneqq \infty$, where $T \langle t_s, s \rangle$
							\item Timed Transition: The transition with the minimal timeout value is selected, 
								i.e. transition $\delta_t$ from state $s_t$ where $\forall q \in Q_t: t_q \geq t_s$, than the following rules apply:
								the global time is set $t \coloneqq t_s$, the local clock is set to infinity: 
								$t_s \coloneqq \infty$ and move to through $\delta_t : s \rightarrow s'$ the next state according to $\delta_t$.
						\end{enumerate}			
				\end{enumerate}
			
			\subsubsection{Timed Region Automaton}
				\begin{dfn}
					\label{dfn:cep:trea}
					A Timed Region Event Automaton $\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0, F, t, T \rangle$ where
					\begin{itemize}
						\item $Q, \Sigma, q_0, F,$ and  $t$ are the same as in Definition \ref{dfn:cep:tea},
						\item $T$ is a set of timeout clocks for sets of states, i.e. a set of tuples $\langle \mathit{Reg}, \RR \rangle$
						\item and $\delta$ is the union of discrete and timed transitions i.e. $\delta_t \cup \delta_d$ where
						\begin{itemize}
							\item $\delta_d$ is defined as in Definition \ref{dfn:cep:tea},
							\item and $\delta_t$ represents timed transitions and defined as the set of tuples $\langle R , \mathbb{R} , Q \rangle$ 
						\end{itemize}
						\item For Syntactic sugar we are going to use $R$ as short for Regions, the set of which have outgoing timed transitions 
						i.e. $ \forall R_i \in R , \exists t, \exists q  \subseteq \delta_t \langle R_i, t, q \rangle$ 
					\end{itemize}
				\end{dfn}
				
				The semantic of the Timed Region Automaton is defined as follows:
				$Q_t \subseteq Q$ is the set of states with outgoing timed transitions, 
				i.e. $\forall q \in Q_t$ : $ q \in R $. CHECK THIS
				Let us use the following notations: 
			
				$s$ is the currently active state, and $s'$ is the state the next state according to $\delta$.
			
				$r$ is the set of currently active regions, 
				i.e. $r \subseteq R$ where $\exists r_s : r_s \in r, s \in r_s $ 
				
				$r'$ is the set of regions we enter,
				i.e. $r \subseteq R$ where $\exists r_s :  r_s \in r, s' \in r_s $ 
				
				$r^+ \subseteq R$ is a set of new timed regions we just entered,
				i.e. $r^+ = r' \setminus r$ 
				
				$r^- \subseteq R$ is a set of timed regions we just left
				i.e. $r^- = r \setminus r'$
			
				We have to define rules for the initialization of the automaton,
				entering states with timed outgoing transitions 
				and we also define the general rules of changing states. 
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Initialization Rule : At the initialization  of the automaton, we have to set all clock variables to $\infty$ 
					i.e. $\forall t_i, \forall q_i, T \langle r_i, t_i \rangle, t_i \coloneqq \infty $, where $r_i \in R$
				
					\item Entering new timed region rule :
					If we enter a new set of timed regions, 
					i.e. $r^+ \neq \emptyset$, 
					we set the timers according to the timeouts, 
					i.e. $\forall t_{timeout} : t_{timeout} \coloneqq t + t_i $ where $ r_t \in r^+, \exists q ,\delta_t\langle  r_t,t_i,q \rangle, T \langle r_t, t_{timeout} \rangle$
					
					\item Firing Transition Rule: Choose an enabled transition from the set of enabled\footnote{non defined} discrete or timed transitions. 
					We have two cases, the chosen transition is:
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Discrete Transition: In case of $r^- = \emptyset$ than the execution of the transition is as in described formerly. 
								If we exit a region i.e. $r^- \neq \emptyset$, 
								then the following rule extends the firing rule of discrete transitions:
								$\forall t_s, \forall q_s$ in $ \delta_t \langle r_i, t_s, q_s \rangle$ where $r_i \in r^-$, the timer of the regions are invalidated i.e.
								$t_s \coloneqq \infty$
							\item Timed Transition: The transition with the minimal timeout value is selected, 
								 i.e. transition $\exists t_i, \exists s_i, \delta_t \langle r_i, t_i, s_i \rangle$ where $ r_i \in r$ and $t_{min}$ is the minimum from all $t_i$,
								 than the following rules apply:
								 the global time is set $t \coloneqq t_{min}$, 
								 the local clock is set to infinity: $t_s \coloneqq \infty$ 
								 and move to the next state according to $\delta_t$.
						\end{enumerate}			
				\end{enumerate}


			
		\subsection{Parametric Timed Regular Expression}
			Complex systems usually have parametric behaviours, which can be expressed by formalisms extended with parameters. In this section we overview such formalisms
			that generate the parametric timed regular languages and an automaton formalism accepting them.
			
			\begin{dfn}
			A Parametric Timed Regular Expression is a timed regular expression where the set of events are defined as a set of tuples. $\langle \Sigma P \rangle$,
			where $\Sigma$ is defined as formerly and P is a set of parameters.
			\end{dfn}
		
			\subsection{Parametric Timed Region Automaton}
				
				
				We use $s$ to denote a tuple $\langle s_0,\dots,s_k \rangle$. We use $X \rightarrow Y$ and $\rightharpoondown$ to denote sets of total and partial function between
				$X$ and $Y$, respectively. We write maps (partial functions) as $[x_0 \mapsto v_0,\dots,x_i \mapsto v_i]$ and the empty maps as $[]$. Given two maps $A$ and $B$,
				the map override operator is defined as:
					\[
					 (A \dagger B)(x) = 
					  \begin{cases} 
					   B(x) & \text{if } x \in \text{\underline{dom}(B)} \\
					   A(x) & \text{if } x \notin \text{\underline{dom}(B)} \text{ and } x \in \text{\underline{dom}(A)} \\
					   \text{undefined otherwise.}
					  \end{cases}
					\]
				
				\begin{dfn}
					(Smybols, Events, Alphabets and Traces).
					Let $\mathit{Sym} = \mathit{Val} \cup \mathit{Var}$ be the set of all symbols (variables or values).
					An event is a pair $\langle e, \overline{s} \rangle \in \Sigma \times \mathit{Sym}^\ast,$ written $e(\overline{s})$.
					An event $e(\overline{s})$ is ground if $\overline{s} \in \mathit{Val}^\ast$.
					Let Event be the set of all events and GEvent be the set of all ground events.
					A trace is a finite sequence of ground events.
					Let Trace = $GEvent^\ast$ be the set of all traces
				\end{dfn}
				
				\begin{dfn}
					(Substitution).
					The binding $\theta = [x_0 \mapsto v_0, \dots, x_i \mapsto v_i]$ can be applied to a symbol $s$ and to an event
					$e(\overline{s})$ as follows: 
					\[
					 s(\theta) = 
					  \begin{cases} 
					   \theta(s) & \text{if } s \in \underline{dom}(\theta) \\
					   s & \text{otherwise}
					  \end{cases}
					  \qquad e \langle s_0,\ldots,s_j \rangle (\theta) = e \langle s_0(\theta),\ldots,s_j(\theta) \rangle
					\]
				\end{dfn}
				
				\begin{dfn}
					(Matching).
					Given a ground event a an event b the predicate matches (a, b) hold if there exists a binding $\theta$ s.t. b($\theta$) = a.
					Moreover let match(a,b) denote the smallest such binding w.r.t $\sqsubseteq$ if it exists (and is undefined otherwise)
				\end{dfn}
				
				\begin{dfn}
					(Configurations and Transition Relation).
					We define configurations as elements o the set Config = Q $\times$ Bind. Let $\rightarrow \subseteq$ Config $\times$ GEvent $\times$ Config be a relation on
					configurations s.t. configurations $\langle q, \varphi \rangle$ and $\langle q', \varphi' \rangle$ are related by the ground event a, written
					$\langle q, \varphi \rangle \xrightarrow{\text{a}} \langle q' \varphi' \rangle$ if, and only if
						\begin{align}
							\exists b \in \mathcal{A}, & \exists \gamma \in Assign : (q, b, \gamma, q') \in \delta \wedge \\
							&matches(a,b) \wedge \varphi' = \gamma(\varphi \dagger match(a,b))
						\end{align}
					Let the transition relation $\rightarrow_{E}$ be the smallest relation containing $\rightarrow$ such that for any event
					$a$ and configuration $c$ if $\nexists c' : c \xrightarrow{\text{a}} c'$ then $ c \xrightarrow{\text{a}}_E c$.
					The relation $\rightarrow_E$ is lifted to traces.
					For any two configurations $c$ and $c'$, $ c \xrightarrow{\text{$\epsilon$}}_E c$ holds, and $\xrightarrow{\text{a.$\tau$}}_E c'$ holds
					if there exist a configuration $c'$ s.t. $c \xrightarrow{\text{a}}_E c'' \xrightarrow{\text{$\tau$}}_E c'$
				\end{dfn}
				
				
				\begin{dfn}
					\label{dfn:cep:ptrea}
					A Parametric Timed Region Event Automaton $\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0, F, t, T \rangle$ where
					\begin{itemize}
						\item $Q, \Sigma, q_0, F,$ and  $t$ are the same as in Definition \ref{dfn:cep:trea},
						\item $T$ is a set of timeout clocks for sets of states, for each token, i.e. a set of tuples $\langle R, \RR, B \rangle$, where $B$ is a binding
						\item and $\delta$ is the union of discrete and timed transitions i.e. $\delta_t \cup \delta_d$ where
						\begin{itemize}
							\item $\delta_d$ is defined as in Definition \ref{dfn:cep:trea},
							\item and $\delta_t$ represents timed transitions and defined as the set of tuples $\langle R \times \mathbb{R} \times Q \rangle$ 
						\end{itemize}
					\end{itemize}
				\end{dfn}
				
				We give the following semantics to the Parametric Timed Region Automaton:
				
				We have to define rules for the initialization of the automaton,
				entering states with timed outgoing transitions 
				and we also define the general rules of changing states. 
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Initialization Rule : On initialization of the automaton, $T$ is an empty set
					i.e. $T = \emptyset$
				
					\item Entering new timed region rule :
					If we enter a new set of timed regions, with a token with binding $b$ 
					i.e. $r^+ \neq \emptyset$, 
					we set the timers according to the timeouts, 
					i.e. $\forall t_{timeout} : t_{timeout} \coloneqq t + t_i $ where $ r_t \in r^+, \exists q ,\delta_t\langle  r_t,t_i,q \rangle, T \langle r_t,b, t_{timeout} \rangle$
					
					\item Firing Transitions Rule: Choose an enabled transition from the set of enabled\footnote{non defined} discrete or timed transitions. 
					We have two cases, the chosen transition is:
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Discrete Transition: In case of $r^- = \emptyset$ than the execution of the transition is as in described formerly. 
								If else if we exit a zone i.e. $r^- = \emptyset$, 
								then the following rule extends the firing rule of discrete transitions:
								$\forall t_s, \forall q_s$ in $ \delta_t \langle r_i, t_s, q_s \rangle$ where $r_i \in r^-$, the timer of the regions are invalidated i.e.
								$t_s \coloneqq \infty$
							\item Timed Transition: The transition with the minimal timeout value is selected, 
								 i.e. transition $\exists t_i, \exists s_i, \delta_t \langle r_i, t_i, s_i \rangle$ where $ r_i \in r$ and $t_{min}$ is the minimum from all $t_i$,
								 than the following rules apply:
								 the global time is set $t \coloneqq t_{min}$, 
								 the local clock is set to infinity: $t_s \coloneqq \infty$ 
								 and move to the next state according to $\delta_t$.
						\end{enumerate}			
				\end{enumerate}

			
	\section{Examples of Complex Event Processing}
 
 
		\subsection{File System}
			\subsubsection{Problem}
				File system - A file shouldn't be read when it has been opened for writing, and shouldn't be written, when opened for reading. 
				A file shouldn't be opened for writing and reading without a close event between the two different opens~\citep{marq}.
				The possible parametrized events are : 
				Open(file, mode), 
				Close(file), 
				Read(file), 
				Write(file). 
				Mode is either "R" or "W" which stands for Read and Write respectively.
			\subsubsection{Solution}
				We are looking for these patterns :

				\begin{itemize}
					\item open(f,"W") $\rightarrow$ NOT close(f)$\{\ast\}$ $\rightarrow$ open(f,"R");
					\item open(f,"R") $\rightarrow$ NOT close(f)$\{\ast\}$ $\rightarrow$ open(f,"W");
					\item open(f,"W") $\rightarrow$ NOT close(f)$\{\ast\}$ $\rightarrow$ read(f);
					\item open(f,"R") $\rightarrow$ NOT close(f)$\{\ast\}$ $\rightarrow$ write(f);
				\end{itemize}

				These event patterns can be matched with the automaton seen on \cref{fig:cep:fileautomaton}

		\subsection{Mars Rover Tasking - Two phase locking}
			\subsubsection{Problem}
				In concurrent systems the avoidance of deadlocks and livelocks are an utmost importance.
				To solve this problem, one of the many patterns is  the two phase locking - which can be defined by two rules.
				These rules are : 
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item \label{itm:cep:mp1} Every task must allocate the resources in a given order.
					\item \label{itm:cep:mp2} If a task releases a resource, it can't allocate anymore
				\end{enumerate}
			\subsubsection{Solution}
				Since our implementation doesn't support guards \emph{yet} we can only use constant amount of resources.
				For this example, this amount will be set to two, to minimize the model of the example.
				The \cref{itm:cep:mp1} pattern can be matched with the \cref {fig:cep:marsautomaton1}, and the \cref{itm:cep:mp2}

		\subsection{Executor}
			The algorithm first searches for all the activated transitions.
			If it finds an activated transition, it iterates over the tokens which are on the state. The first token with matching (non-confronting)
			parameter list will be split to the next state if there are new parameter bindings from the event, or moved if there are no new bindings.
			If a token enters an acceptor state it'll
