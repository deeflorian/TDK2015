We would like to thank Istán Dávid for his advice, help getting familiar with the concepts of complex event processing and his support in using VIATRA-CEP.
His suggestions helped us a lot to choose the research direction presented in this report.

We would also like to thank our supervisors Dr. István Ráth and Dr. Dániel Varró
for their advice and help -- even during weekends. 

We would like to thank IncQuery Labs Ltd. and Quanopt Ltd. for their support during our summer internship.

We would also like to thank Oszkár Semeráth for the help in the modeling process, Kristóf Marussy for time he spent helping us, and Tamás Tóth for his infinite patience and persistence during our consults regarding timer-related issues.

Last but not least, we would like to thank András Vörös for the infinite hours of support, caffeine, and pizza provided during our never ending consultations.
