\chapter{Overview of the approach}
\label{chap:overview}

This case study concentrates on the connection between the design time, and the runtime domain. Our goal is to connect these two domains, and make a solution that generally can support the relation between the design, and runtime.

\cref{fig:overview:abstract_overview} depict the basic concept. We have three main transformation in the concept:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Engineering model $\mapsto$ Formal model}: 
	\item \textbf{Engineering model $\mapsto$ Generated code}: From the verified model, we can generate an executable implementaion.
	\item \textbf{Engineering model $\mapsto$ Monitor}: Monitor the state of the implementation. If the execution reaches invalid states, the monitor detect it and forward the event of error detection into a higher level processor.
\end{itemize}
Solutions which connect two, or three elements of mapping are existing, but there are no tools which integrate all these in one tool with interchangeable formalisms.

\noindent Let us consider the following example:

We want to design a system, where we have a model of our system, described by using a formalism (e.g. state chart, sequence chart), and we want to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate the implementation from the model.
	\item Implement runtime verification into our implementation, by monitoring the application.
	\item We have multiple monitoring systems, and if a components verification state changes we want to react.
\end{itemize}

This example covers the usual needs of a distributed embedded safety logic. We need to formally verify the model, generate code, and monitor it. Our goal is to integrate all these solutions into a generic tool. With a centralized toolchain, a developer can make a system with less effort but with more robustness thanks to the verifiable, and automated steps.
